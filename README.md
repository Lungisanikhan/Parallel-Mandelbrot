# Parallel-Mandelbrot
Mandelbrot images are aesthetically appealing but can take a lot of computational time to generate depending on the parameters used. This project will explore the use of several parallel programming techniques: GPUs, OpenMP and evaluate the suitability of each technique in speeding up the generation of Mandelbrot images.
